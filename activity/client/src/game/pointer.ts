/**
 * Pointer play: tap to rotate, drag to place, flick down to slam, long-press to hold.
 *
 * The gestures are deliberately the same on a mouse and a finger — a mouse is
 * just a finger that never loses contact — so one state machine serves both.
 * It is pure: no DOM, and every decision surfaces either as a returned
 * gesture or through the constructor's `emit`, which is what makes it
 * testable without a browser and keeps the adapter below a thin shell.
 *
 * The keyboard plays *keys*; a pointer plays *places*. A drag ends in the
 * piece going where it was carried — committed if it fits, parked as a
 * dashed preview if it does not, reset if the carry ended off the board —
 * and the run owns that verdict; this layer never synthesises soft drop or
 * rides gravity, it only reports where the drag has carried the piece.
 *
 * The carry is the Block Blast model, and it is *relative*, never absolute
 * about the piece: a drag starts from the piece's current position — a seat a
 * previous release parked it on included — and every move applies the
 * finger's amplified travel from where the press landed, {@link TOUCH_CARRY}
 * squares per finger square on both axes, measured as a whole and truncated
 * to whole squares — with the sub-square samples a real pointer stream
 * produces, every square on the way is visited. The piece moves by the
 * finger's travel, never to the finger: the press square is the origin of the
 * measurement, not a destination the piece is snapped to. The travel is
 * never clamped: a drag may wander far off
 * the board and back, and the piece lands exactly where it was — a round trip
 * computes to a shift of zero, because the measurement is absolute. While the
 * carried position sits off the board the preview drops (that is the reset
 * the model asks for) but the drag stays live; correcting the finger brings
 * the preview back before the release. Releasing on the board settles the
 * piece exactly as previewed — a placeable seat opens the rest gate, a
 * blocked one parks — and releasing off the board resets the piece to
 * falling. A clean downward swipe is a slam instead: a stroke that only
 * descends — every movement deeper or a square's blip shallower (truncation
 * noise: the stroke keeps its deepest row), the whole chord judged by its
 * ANGLE on the lift rather than per-sample column rules
 * ({@link SLAM_MAX_ANGLE}) — hard-drops the position the piece was shown
 * at when the stroke began, on the release, skipping the release-and-rest
 * wait a settle begins. A pause ends a stroke, armed or not ({@link
 * SLAM_PAUSE_MS}): positioning and swiping are decisions a player makes in
 * either order on one contact, and stillness is the boundary between them —
 * the stroke that outlives the pause is positioning, whatever it armed on
 * the way down. A stroke may begin anywhere the finger has been still: the
 * drag's first movement, or a fresh descent after that beat
 * (measured by the piece — if the preview moved, it wasn't a pause) —
 * positioning and swiping can share one contact, separated by a beat. The
 * preview keeps following the finger the whole way, and the drop follows
 * the STROKE: the slam is one input command, not a drag plus a drop, so
 * the seat it takes is the one shown when the stroke began — the same
 * motion the player made, descended to rest. A dive flowed straight out of
 * positioning without a pause is only carrying: the release settles exactly
 * as if the swipe had never happened.
 *
 * Fingers also come in chords: a tap of two is an undo and a tap of three a
 * redo ({@link MultiTapTracker}). The chord counts every contact the stage
 * sees — including the one the single-finger game is playing — because the
 * primary contact of a two-finger tap is, to {@link PointerGestureTracker},
 * indistinguishable from a solo tap; the adapter suppresses that tap's
 * rotation when the chord says the contact had company. A drag or a hold
 * voids any chord, and a second finger landing re-arms the hold clock, so
 * fingers resting together never read as a long-press.
