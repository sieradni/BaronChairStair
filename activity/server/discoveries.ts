/**
 * Filing what a player actually did, so the archive learns from being played.
 *
 * Every solved run already carries everything a solution row needs — the
 * placements the server derived, the log they were derived from, and the score
 * the engine gave them. This is the small decision of which of those to keep
 * and what to tell the player about it.
 *
 * The two readers pull in opposite directions and both are served by keeping
 * *more* than the leaderboard pays for. A player is credited for a line nobody
 * had recorded that either solved the puzzle or sent more attack than it asked
 * for — `countsAsAlternate`. A maker needs the rest as well: a line that met
 * the target exactly while missing the required clears is the exact evidence
 * that a condition says less than its sentence does. So both are filed, and
 * `solvedStrict` is the stored fact that tells them apart.

/**
 * Puts the archive's own answer on record, so nobody can discover it.
 *
 * `recordDiscovery` decides "nobody had found this line before" by fingerprint
 * novelty alone, and the intended solution was never written down. The first
 * player to solve a puzzle *the way its maker did* therefore collided with
 * nothing and was credited with finding an alternate — on every puzzle, once —
 * while the "N distinct lines" count they were shown was one too high.
 *
 * `SolutionSource` has carried a `reference` case since the table existed and
 * `discoveryBoard` already excludes it by name. This is the producer that was
 * missing. Filed with no `foundBy`, so no board can pay for it.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: `recordSolution` is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` over
 * `(puzzle_id, canonical_key)`, so this may run on every boot. That also makes it
 * self-healing after a creator edits a puzzle — the new answer keys differently
 * and is seeded on the next start, beside the old one, which is correct: the line
 * the previous answer described was still a real line on the previous board, and
 * `voidDiscoveries` is what settles the credit for it.
 *
 * **Only where the answers are.** `data/solutions.json` is untracked, so on an
 * ordinary deploy box every club puzzle arrives without its `solution` and there
 * is nothing to seed. Those are counted and skipped rather than throwing: a boot
 * that dies over a missing answer key would be a far worse failure than a
 * discovery credited to the wrong person.
