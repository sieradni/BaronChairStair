/**
 * The screen itself: structure and the CSS contracts the layout turns on.
 *
 * These exist because three bugs in a row reached a player through a gap the
 * rest of the suite cannot see. `bun test` has no document, so mounting order,
 * canvas sizing and scroll containers were all invisible here and every one of
 * them was found by hand in Discord and fixed by reading.
 *
 * happy-dom closes part of that gap and not all of it. It builds a real DOM and
 * cascades real stylesheets, so "which rules apply to this element" is testable
 * and is what these assert. It does **no layout**: nothing here can tell you a
 * card overflowed its screen, that a wheel event chained, or that a canvas was
 * cleared. Those are still read, not run.
