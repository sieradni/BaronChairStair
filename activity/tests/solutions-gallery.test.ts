/**
 * Every way a puzzle has been solved, and who is allowed to read them.
 *
 * The panel beside the board used to step one line and say "One solution on
 * file — there may well be others." There were others; the archive had been
 * recording them for weeks and nobody could look at them.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here. **What the gallery holds**: the maker's answer
 * first, then the people who found something, oldest first, and never a
 * machine's output. And **what it must not leak**: these are answers, several
 * of them, so the gate is the one the reveal already used rather than a second
 * rule that could drift from it.
