 *
 * Two things a maker wants from this, and they are not the same claim.
 *
 * **"My condition is loose."** A puzzle with alternates can be finished by a
 * line its author did not intend, which is usually a condition that says less
 * than the sentence next to it. That is a *finding*, and one alternate is
 * enough to make it.
 *
 * **"My condition is tight."** That is a *proof*, and only an exhausted search
 * can offer it. Every other way of stopping means the search ran out of budget
 * with ground left unexplored, and the report says which — because the failure
 * that matters here is a maker reading a truncated search as a clean bill of
 * health. And an exhausted search that found *nothing* is a third answer again —
 * the puzzle cannot be finished at all — reported loudly rather than counted
 * among the tight ones.
 *
 * Exhausting is rarer than "short puzzles finish" suggests: measured at a
 * twenty-second budget, every puzzle of three pieces or fewer exhausts,
 * four-piece 5 times in 8, six-piece 1 in 10, and nothing of seven or more. It
 * is also scoped to the default soft drop — see
 * `RoutePlanner.restingPlacements`.
 *
 * `--write` files what it finds as `enumerated` rows, which are credited to
 * nobody: they seed the archive with what is already known so that the first
 * player to *play* one of these lines is told it is known, rather than being
 * paid for rediscovering something a machine had already listed.
